This project utilizes the use of the OMDB API at https://www.omdbapi.com/, an open movie database. In other words, it's basically a makeshift version of the IMDB website. 
It uses promises, GET requests and fetch methods in order to work. To use the project effectively, the user has to be very accurate with the movie or TV show title they put in the search bar. Failure to do so would make it say "Movie Not Found".
For example, to find Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the user must type it in this way, instead of "Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2" or Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. Two". The API use includes modern shows and movies
that have been released and officially upcoming.
